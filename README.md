# Michiaventura-Source
Source code from my game Michiaventura!

In the _Deprecated folder there are systems and code that didn't make the cut to the final game. The "CraftSystem" was a system that player could use to find resources exploring and transforming them in useful items to continue exploring and progressing the game. Unfortunately, the crafting system wasn't aligned with my new vision for the project, and remained unused.
